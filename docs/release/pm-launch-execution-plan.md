# PM Launch Execution Plan

> **TL;DR:** Testnet-first, mainnet-is-ceremony model. Phase 0 proves everything on testnets with exhaustive integration, scenario, and simulation evidence — mainnet is a mechanical replay. Phase 1 hardens AMM on the frozen PM base. Phase 2 integrates AMM with the PM stack. PR #19 is excluded from the launch-critical merge train.

## Core Principle: Testnet-First, Mainnet-Is-Ceremony

Every deployment, governance action, integration test, and scenario simulation is executed and proven on testnets first. Mainnet deployment is a mechanical replay of the exact same runbook with production keys. Zero decisions at deploy time. Zero debugging at deploy time. If it wasn't proven on testnet, it doesn't happen on mainnet.

---

## Phase 0 — Get PM Gates True

**Branch:** `release/pm-gates-closeout`
**Parent:** `enoomian/pm16-17-20-21` (after PR #27 merges to develop)
**Goal:** Prove the entire deployment, governance, and integration pipeline on testnets. Capture exhaustive evidence. Make mainnet deployment a mechanical ceremony.

### Stage A — Testnet Proving Ground (Engineering)

Everything in Stage A is executed by engineering on testnets with test funds. No real funds. No production keys. Full control. Full debuggability. This is where all problems are found and fixed.

#### WS 0.1A — Testnet Deployment

- [ ] Materialize the Stage A deploy env from [`testnet-operations-ledger.md`](/Users/mac/Desktop/hyperbet/.claude/worktrees/blissful-golick/docs/release/testnet-operations-ledger.md) into either local `packages/evm-contracts/.env` or workflow runtime env before rerunning `deploy:preflight:testnet`
- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on BSC Testnet
- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on Base Sepolia
- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on AVAX Fuji
- [ ] Deploy Safe multisig (2-of-3) on BSC Testnet

- [ ] Execute `freeze_config` on Solana devnet
- [ ] Record all testnet tx hashes in evidence bundle

**Acceptance:** All 3 EVM testnets + Solana devnet deployed with identical governance topology as production target.

#### WS 0.2A — Testnet Registry Population

- [ ] Populate chain-registry `bscTestnet` with deployed v3 addresses
- [ ] Populate chain-registry `baseSepolia` with deployed v3 addresses

- [ ] Verify `bun x tsc --noEmit` passes for all chain apps

**Acceptance:** Registry is complete for all testnets. No blank fields. Deployment tests pass.

#### WS 0.3A — Deployment Verification Script

Build a script that validates a deployment is correct. Run it on testnet. Run it again on mainnet later.

- [ ] Create `scripts/verify-deployment.ts` that takes a chain config and checks:
  - [ ] Contracts deployed at expected CREATE2 addresses (`getCode` != `0x`)
  - [ ] Oracle constructor args match: admin, reporter, finalizer, challenger, pauser, disputeWindow
  - [ ] CLOB constructor args match: admin, operator, oracle, treasury, marketMaker, pauser
  - [ ] `duelOracle`, `treasury`, `marketMaker` are immutable and match expected values
  - [ ] `grantRole(REPORTER_ROLE, ...)` reverts with `GovernanceSurfaceFrozen`
  - [ ] `setFeeConfig(...)` reverts with `GovernanceSurfaceFrozen`
  - [ ] Timelock is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` holder
  - [ ] Fee config matches expected snapshot values
  - [ ] Dispute window == 3600 (or expected value)
- [ ] Create `scripts/verify-solana-deployment.ts` that checks:
  - [ ] Program deployed at expected address
  - [ ] OracleConfig authority matches expected pubkey
  - [ ] OracleConfig `config_frozen == true`
  - [ ] OracleConfig `paused == false`
  - [ ] MarketConfig authority, treasury, market_maker match expected
  - [ ] MarketConfig `config_frozen == true`
  - [ ] Upgrade authority transferred (no longer original deployer)
- [ ] Run verification scripts against all testnet deployments
- [ ] All checks pass

**Acceptance:** Automated verification confirms deployment correctness on all testnets.

#### WS 0.4A — UI and Game Integration Testing

  - [ ] CI gate (all chains, min 13 passes)
- [ ] Run extended fuzz testing: `forge test --fuzz-runs 2048`
- [ ] Run keeper lifecycle test:
  - [ ] Start keeper against testnet
  - [ ] Verify keeper creates markets from game events
  - [ ] Verify keeper syncs oracle state
  - [ ] Kill keeper, restart, verify recovery
  - [ ] Verify no state corruption after restart
- [ ] Run pause/unpause drill:
  - [ ] Pause oracle on testnet

**Acceptance:** Every exploit scenario, adversarial simulation, and operational drill passes on testnets. Evidence artifacts captured and indexed.

#### WS 0.6A — Evidence Bundle Assembly

- [ ] Create `docs/release/evidence/` directory with structured evidence:
  - [ ] `testnet-deployment-receipts/` — tx hashes, explorer links, verification script output for each chain
  - [ ] `testnet-governance-receipts/` — timelock deploy, multisig deploy, role assignment, freeze tx hashes
  - [ ] `testnet-integration-evidence/` — UI flow screenshots/recordings, game integration evidence
  - [ ] `testnet-scenario-evidence/` — exploit gate results, adversarial simulation reports, fuzz results

- [ ] Create `docs/release/evidence/testnet-signoff-summary.md` — single document linking all evidence with pass/fail status
- [ ] Verify every item in `docs/release/external-audit-package-checklist.md` can be checked with testnet evidence

**Acceptance:** Complete evidence bundle exists. Every claim is backed by a testnet artifact.

**Acceptance:** Everything that will happen on mainnet has been proven on testnet. No open questions.

---

### Stage B — Mainnet Deployment Ceremony (Admin Ops)

Stage B is a ceremony, not an engineering session. Every action here is a mechanical replay of what was proven in Stage A. The admin follows the runbook exactly. No improvisation. No debugging. If something fails, stop — do not proceed until the failure is understood and re-proven on testnet.

**Prerequisites:** Stage A signoff complete. Testnet RC tagged. Evidence bundle reviewed.

**Who:** Admin with production keys. Engineering on standby for observation only.

**Duration:** ~2 hours for all chains.

#### Step B.1 — Pre-Ceremony Verification

- [ ] Verify the branch being deployed matches the testnet RC tag exactly
- [ ] Verify production deployer wallet has sufficient gas on BSC, Base, AVAX
- [ ] Verify production Solana deployer has sufficient SOL
- [ ] Verify Safe multisig signers have confirmed availability
- [ ] Verify Squads multisig signers have confirmed availability
- [ ] Communication: notify stakeholders that mainnet deployment is starting

#### Step B.2 — EVM Mainnet Deployment (Replay of WS 0.1A)

- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on BSC — record tx hash
- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on Base — record tx hash
- [ ] Deploy `TimelockController` on AVAX — record tx hash
- [ ] Deploy Safe multisig on BSC — record address
- [ ] Deploy Safe multisig on Base — record address
- [ ] Deploy Safe multisig on AVAX — record address
- [ ] Run `deploy-create2.ts --network bsc` with timelock as admin — record receipt
- [ ] Run `deploy-create2.ts --network base` with timelock as admin — record receipt
- [ ] Run `deploy-create2.ts --network avax` with timelock as admin — record receipt
- [ ] Verify CREATE2 addresses match testnet predictions (must be identical)
- [ ] If addresses don't match: STOP. Do not proceed. Investigate on testnet first.

#### Step B.3 — Solana Mainnet Deployment (Replay of WS 0.1A)

- [ ] Deploy fight_oracle program on mainnet — record program ID
- [ ] Deploy gold_clob_market program on mainnet — record program ID
- [ ] Verify program IDs match expected values
- [ ] Initialize oracle config with production governance keys
- [ ] Initialize market config with production governance keys
- [ ] Transfer upgrade authority to Squads multisig — record tx
- [ ] Execute `freeze_oracle_config` — record tx
- [ ] Execute `freeze_config` — record tx

#### Step B.4 — Post-Deployment Verification (Replay of WS 0.3A)

- [ ] Run `verify-deployment.ts` against BSC mainnet
- [ ] Run `verify-deployment.ts` against Base mainnet
- [ ] Run `verify-deployment.ts` against AVAX mainnet
- [ ] Run `verify-solana-deployment.ts` against Solana mainnet
- [ ] All verification checks pass
- [ ] If any check fails: STOP. Do not proceed. Investigate.

#### Step B.5 — Registry Population

- [ ] Populate chain-registry mainnet entries with deployed addresses
- [ ] Populate governance addresses (timelock, multisig, emergency council)
- [ ] Update `deploymentVersion` to `"v3"` for all mainnet entries
- [ ] Commit registry updates
- [ ] Run `bun test` deployment tests — all pass

#### Step B.6 — Post-Ceremony Verification

- [ ] Run smoke test against mainnet deployments (read-only — no real funds yet)
- [ ] Verify block explorer shows correct constructor args on all chains
- [ ] Verify governance roles on all chains via block explorer
- [ ] Verify freeze state on Solana via explorer

#### Step B.7 — Ceremony Completion

- [ ] Tag mainnet RC: `v3.0.0`
- [ ] Record all mainnet tx hashes in `docs/release/evidence/mainnet-deployment-receipts/`
- [ ] Update launch-freeze tracker with mainnet evidence
- [ ] Communication: notify stakeholders that mainnet deployment is complete
- [ ] Explicit signoff: "Mainnet deployment complete. Contracts verified. Ready for canary operations."

**Acceptance:** Mainnet matches testnet exactly. Verification scripts pass. All evidence recorded. Admin's job is done.

## Phase 1 — PM-AMM Hardening

**Branch:** `feature/pm-amm-hardening-v1`
**Parent:** `release/pm-gates-closeout` (after Phase 0 merges)
**Goal:** Bring AMM code to PM-core quality bar. Do NOT reopen PM16/17/20/21 semantics.

### WS 1.1 — Branch Surgery

- [ ] Start from merged PM-gates base (NOT from PR #19)
- [ ] Cherry-pick only AMM-specific commits from PR #19:
  - [ ] `packages/evm-contracts/contracts/lvr_amm/LvrMarket.sol`
  - [ ] `packages/evm-contracts/contracts/lvr_amm/Router.sol`
  - [ ] `packages/evm-contracts/contracts/lvr_amm/lib/*.sol`
  - [ ] `packages/hyperbet-solana/anchor/programs/lvr_amm/`
- [ ] Exclude unrelated dashboard/frontend/shared-runtime/keeper churn
- [ ] Verify PM-core contracts are unchanged after cherry-pick

**Acceptance:** AMM diff is AMM-focused and reviewable. No accidental reintroduction of superseded work.

### WS 1.2 — EVM AMM Remediation

- [ ] Add Router market allowlist; enforce in all callbacks
- [ ] Validate callback asset addresses against market metadata
- [ ] Put `setFeeConfig` behind `onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)` with fee caps
- [ ] Remove or redesign standalone AMM dispute/settlement path — cannot bypass PM-core finality
- [ ] Fix dynamic price read/execution parity (time-decayed liquidity in reads, not just swaps)
- [ ] Replace `f64` floating-point math if present
- [ ] Add `nonReentrant` to Router
- [ ] Add slippage protection (`minAmountOut`) to swap functions
- [ ] Add oracle staleness checks
- [ ] Add exploit regression tests:
  - [ ] Malicious callback caller
  - [ ] Unauthorized config change
  - [ ] Dispute bypass
  - [ ] Price/reporting divergence

**Acceptance:** Non-market callers always revert. Unauthorized config always reverts. AMM settlement cannot bypass PM-core truth. Price views match execution.

### WS 1.3 — Solana AMM Remediation

- [ ] Replace per-market caller-supplied `fee_bps` and `treasury` with protocol-owned Config PDA
- [ ] Remove unchecked treasury ATA fee routing; enforce canonical treasury ATA constraints
- [ ] Replace `admin_state.admin` settlement with PM-core resolution model or thin oracle adapter
- [ ] Add freeze/pause parity aligned with PM-core (`freeze_config`, `set_paused`)
- [ ] Replace all `f64` floating-point math with fixed-point integer arithmetic
- [ ] Add negative tests:
  - [ ] Wrong ATA
  - [ ] Wrong owner
  - [ ] Wrong mint
  - [ ] Unauthorized config
  - [ ] Unauthorized settlement

**Acceptance:** Fee routing cannot be redirected. Unauthorized settlement always fails. AMM config matches PM-core posture.

### WS 1.4 — AMM Assurance Package

- [ ] Build independent AMM reference model
- [ ] Add invariant suites:
  - [ ] Accounting conservation
  - [ ] Fee conservation
  - [ ] Reserve non-negativity
  - [ ] Complement pricing
  - [ ] Terminal redemption
  - [ ] Read/execution parity
- [ ] Add edge-case and fuzz coverage:
  - [ ] Near expiry
  - [ ] Low liquidity
  - [ ] Large orders
  - [ ] Fee edge cases
- [ ] Document allowed parameter ranges and launch-eligible market classes

**Acceptance:** AMM passes invariants on every commit. Value-moving paths have property tests. Parameterization memo exists.

---

## Phase 2 — PM-AMM Integration

**Branch:** `feature/pm-amm-integration-v1`
**Parent:** `feature/pm-amm-hardening-v1` (after Phase 1 merges)
**Goal:** Integrate hardened AMM with the existing prediction-market stack.

### WS 2.1 — Shared Resolution and Lifecycle Integration

- [ ] AMM markets resolve off same truth model as PM-core (reporter/challenger/finalizer)
- [ ] Require explicit market-level resolution metadata (source, end date, edge cases, dispute flow)
- [ ] AMM terminal states map to claim/refund semantics
- [ ] No standalone AMM resolution path remains outside PM-core truth model

### WS 2.2 — Market-Type Integration Strategy

- [ ] Launch PM-AMM as separate market type (not hidden fallback inside GoldClob)
- [ ] Keep CLOB and AMM routing explicit in app, indexer, analytics
- [ ] Add feature flags for per-market AMM enable/disable
- [ ] GoldClob PM gates stay true and unchanged

### WS 2.3 — Offchain Orderflow and Runtime Discipline

- [ ] Keep PM-AMM bot/keeper components non-trust-bearing
- [ ] Add order/quote TTLs, replay protection, restart behavior
- [ ] Document what is convenience infra vs safety-critical
- [ ] Replay/restart tests pass

### WS 2.4 — Tri-Chain Deployment Integration

- [ ] Extend CREATE2 and registry discipline to AMM EVM deployments on BSC/Base/AVAX
- [ ] Add Solana deployment manifests and authority records for AMM program
- [ ] Add chain-registry entries for AMM
- [ ] Add explorer verification and staged-proof checks for AMM

### WS 2.5 — External Audit and Launch Controls

- [ ] Audit PM-core first (separate engagement)
- [ ] Audit PM-AMM second (separate scoped engagement)
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add bug bounty coverage
- [ ] Add canary liquidity limits before AMM mainnet scale
- [ ] Document kill-switch procedures

**Acceptance:** Zero open critical/high on PM-AMM. PM-core unchanged except auditor-reviewed fixes. Canary rollout limits live.

---

## Forbidden Actions

- Do NOT merge PR #19 into any launch-critical branch
- Do NOT reopen PM16/17/20/21 contract semantics for AMM compatibility
- Do NOT widen the trust-bearing surface by merging keeper/dashboard churn into PM-core
- Do NOT deploy AMM contracts without matching CREATE2/registry/governance discipline
- Do NOT deploy to mainnet anything that wasn't proven on testnet first
- Do NOT debug on mainnet — if something fails during ceremony, stop and return to testnet
