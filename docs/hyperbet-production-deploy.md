# Hyperbet Production Deploy (Cloudflare + Railway)

This is the recommended production topology for the Hyperbet stack in this repo.

Operator runbooks are in [docs/runbooks/README.md](runbooks/README.md).

- Primary frontend (`packages/hyperbet-solana/app`): Cloudflare Pages (`hyperbet.win`)
- Secondary frontends (`packages/hyperbet-bsc/app`, `packages/hyperbet-avax/app`): dedicated Pages project or subdomain per chain
- Primary betting API (`packages/hyperbet-solana/keeper`): Railway
- Secondary betting APIs (`packages/hyperbet-bsc/keeper`, `packages/hyperbet-avax/keeper`): dedicated Railway services if you split by chain
- Live duel/stream source (`packages/server` or Vast duel stack): separate upstream that the keeper polls
- DDoS/WAF/edge cache: Cloudflare proxy in front of the betting API
- Contracts/state: Solana + EVM (configured by env vars below, proxied server-side)

AVAX now has repo-backed Pages and keeper deployment workflows, but production rollout is still blocked until canonical AVAX deployment addresses are committed to the shared chain registry, staged proof artifacts are captured for the target environment, and the real AVAX governance/operator wallets are provisioned.

## Staging Rail

The repo also supports a manual staging rail for Solana, BSC, and AVAX without
changing the production topology:

- staged Solana Pages + staged Solana keeper
- staged BSC Pages + staged BSC keeper
- staged AVAX Pages + staged AVAX keeper
- external staged duel/stream source

Manual staging deploys use the same workflows as production through
`workflow_dispatch`:

- `Deploy Hyperbet Solana Pages`
- `Deploy Hyperbet Solana Keeper`
- `Deploy Hyperbet BSC Pages`
- `Deploy Hyperbet BSC Keeper`
- `Deploy Hyperbet AVAX Pages`
- `Deploy Hyperbet AVAX Keeper`

Select `environment=staging` when dispatching the relevant workflow.

Required staging vars are:

- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_PAGES_STAGING_PROJECT_NAME`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_PAGES_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_KEEPER_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_KEEPER_STAGING_WS_URL`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_RAILWAY_STAGING_PROJECT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_RAILWAY_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_SOLANA_RAILWAY_STAGING_KEEPER_SERVICE_ID`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_PAGES_STAGING_PROJECT_NAME`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_PAGES_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_KEEPER_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_KEEPER_STAGING_WS_URL`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_RAILWAY_STAGING_PROJECT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_RAILWAY_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_BSC_RAILWAY_STAGING_KEEPER_SERVICE_ID`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_PAGES_STAGING_PROJECT_NAME`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_PAGES_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_KEEPER_STAGING_URL`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_KEEPER_STAGING_WS_URL`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_RAILWAY_STAGING_PROJECT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_RAILWAY_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_RAILWAY_STAGING_KEEPER_SERVICE_ID`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_STAGING_CHAIN_ID`
- `HYPERBET_AVAX_STAGING_GOLD_CLOB_ADDRESS`

AVAX rollout remains blocked until canonical deployment truth exists in the shared chain registry and the effective AVAX wallet/signer set is in place. The staging/prod rail is present so proof and release packaging can use one consistent contract once those addresses are committed.

## 1) Deploy the keeper to Railway

From repo root, deploy the keeper service path:

```bash
railway up packages/hyperbet-solana --path-as-root -s gold-betting-keeper
```

Use `packages/hyperbet-solana/railway.json`.

Set these Railway variables at minimum:

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=8080` (or let Railway inject its port if you proxy through the service domain)
- `STREAM_STATE_SOURCE_URL=https://your-stream-source.example/api/streaming/state`
- `STREAM_STATE_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN=...` if the upstream streaming state is protected
- `ARENA_EXTERNAL_BET_WRITE_KEY=...`
- `STREAM_PUBLISH_KEY=...` if you use `/api/streaming/state/publish`
- `SOLANA_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta`
- `SOLANA_RPC_URL=...`
- `BSC_RPC_URL=...`
- `BSC_GOLD_CLOB_ADDRESS=...`
- `BASE_RPC_URL=...`
- `BASE_GOLD_CLOB_ADDRESS=...`
- `AVAX_RPC_URL=...` for AVAX keeper/runtime support after canonical registry values exist
- `BIRDEYE_API_KEY=...` if token-price proxying is enabled

Persistence:

- The keeper defaults to a local SQLite file (`KEEPER_DB_PATH=./keeper.sqlite`).
- On Railway that file is ephemeral unless you attach a persistent volume or move the keeper state to an external database.
- Do not treat points history, referrals, or oracle history as durable unless persistence is configured explicitly.

Notes:

- The keeper serves the Pages app's read/write betting APIs. It is not the same process as the Hyperscape duel server.
- The keeper also proxies Solana and EVM JSON-RPC for the public app. Keep provider-keyed RPC URLs on Railway, not in Cloudflare Pages build vars.
- The keeper now keeps a short in-memory cache for read-only RPC and Birdeye proxy traffic. Tune it with `RPC_PROXY_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`, `RPC_PROXY_CACHE_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, and `BIRDEYE_PRICE_CACHE_TTL_MS` if needed.
- The keeper will return boot fallback duel data until `STREAM_STATE_SOURCE_URL` is set and the upstream duel server responds.
- The autonomous keeper bot also needs a funded signer wallet on Solana to create/resolve markets in production.

## 2) Deploy the live duel server / stream source

This can be the Railway `hyperscape` service or the Vast.ai duel stack. It must expose:

- `/api/streaming/state`
- `/api/streaming/duel-context`
- `/api/streaming/rtmp/status`
- `/live/stream.m3u8`

If you run the Vast.ai stack, verify it before pointing the keeper at it:

```bash
./scripts/check-streaming-status.sh http://127.0.0.1:5555
```

## 3) Put the betting API behind Cloudflare

1. Create `api.yourdomain.com` in Cloudflare DNS and point it to the keeper Railway target.
2. Enable Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) for `api.yourdomain.com`.
3. Add WAF rate-limit rules:
- `POST /api/arena/bet/record-external`
- `POST /api/arena/deposit/ingest`
- `/api/arena/points/*`
4. Keep the direct Railway URL private if you introduce a public API domain.

## 4) Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages

Project root:

- `packages/hyperbet-solana/app`

Build/output:

- Build command: `bun install && bun run build --mode mainnet-beta`
- Output directory: `dist`

Frontend env vars (Cloudflare Pages):

- `VITE_GAME_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com`
- `VITE_GAME_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com/ws` if the keeper exposes websocket features you use
- `VITE_SOLANA_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta` (or testnet/devnet)
- `VITE_USE_GAME_RPC_PROXY=true`
- `VITE_USE_GAME_EVM_RPC_PROXY=true`
- `VITE_BSC_GOLD_CLOB_ADDRESS` / `VITE_BASE_GOLD_CLOB_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_BSC_GOLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS` / `VITE_BASE_GOLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_STREAM_SOURCES=https://your-hls-or-embed-source,...`

Do not set provider-keyed values in any `VITE_*RPC_URL` variable for production builds. The betting app build fails intentionally if a public RPC URL looks like a Helius / Alchemy / Infura / QuickNode / dRPC secret endpoint.

Do not treat `packages/hyperbet-avax/deployments/contracts.json` as production deployment truth. The shared chain registry is the canonical production source, and AVAX rollout must stay blocked until that registry is populated with real addresses.

Cloudflare Pages headers/SPA rules are already added in:

- `packages/hyperbet-solana/app/public/_headers`
- `packages/hyperbet-solana/app/public/_redirects`

Deployment metadata:

- `build-info.json` is emitted into `dist/` on every build and should be served with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
## 5) Verify production

Health:

- `https://api.yourdomain.com/status`
- `https://bet.yourdomain.com`
- `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/streaming/state`
- `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/streaming/duel-context`
- `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/perps/markets`
- `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/proxy/evm/rpc?chain=bsc` (POST JSON-RPC smoke test)
- `https://bet.yourdomain.com/build-info.json`

Repo-backed checks from repo root:

```bash
./scripts/check-streaming-status.sh https://your-stream-source.example
bun run --cwd packages/hyperbet-solana build:mainnet
```

## 6) Run staged live proof

Use the manual `Staged Live Proof` workflow or the repo wrapper:

```bash
bun run staged:proof -- --mode=read-only --target=all
bun run staged:proof -- --mode=canary-write --target=solana
bun run staged:proof -- --mode=canary-write --target=bsc
bun run staged:proof -- --mode=canary-write --target=avax
```

The proof wrapper captures:

- Pages `build-info.json`
- keeper `/status`
- `/api/arena/prediction-markets/active`
- `/api/keeper/bot-health`
- stream-state and duel-context payloads
- Solana and BSC proxy proof
- Solana, BSC, and AVAX canary tx hashes/signatures when `mode=canary-write`
- `verify:chains` output
- AVAX staging env-audit output

This is a manual operator proof rail. It should not be treated as complete
until a real staged run passes end to end and the artifacts are reviewed.

## 7) Security notes

- Do not expose `ARENA_EXTERNAL_BET_WRITE_KEY` in public frontend env vars.
- Do not ship provider-keyed RPC URLs in public frontend env vars. Keep them on Railway and let the keeper proxy them.
- Rotate all secrets before production if they were ever committed/shared.
- Keep `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` unset in production.
