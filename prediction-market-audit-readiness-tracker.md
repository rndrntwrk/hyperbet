# Prediction Market Audit Readiness Tracker

_Last updated: 2026-03-15_

## Purpose

This document is the working tracker for taking `enoomian/prediction-market-sprint-base` from the current baseline state to **tri-chain audit readiness** for prediction markets across **Solana, BSC, and AVAX**, with emphasis on the **smart contracts / Solana programs** and the **AVAX completion track**.

This tracker intentionally does **not** assume the full SoW is done. Only the small subset explicitly reported as completed is marked done. AVAX work already present in PR #20 is marked **in PR / pending merge or verification**, not fully done.

## Source of truth and assumptions

- Integration base for all work: `enoomian/prediction-market-sprint-base`
- AVAX-only branch: `avax/prod-proofing`
- All non-AVAX work: separate branches off sprint base, each merging back into sprint base
- PR #11 remains a **baseline merge** claim, not a launch-ready or audit-ready claim
- PR #20 is an **AVAX Fuji bootstrap / runbook hardening** PR and is not the full AVAX completion track

## Status legend

- `[x]` done in code/workspace and should count toward the plan
- `[~]` implemented in an open PR or partially done, but not yet merged/verified as complete
- `[ ]` not done
- `[!]` blocker / dependency / external ops step

---

# Step 0 — Tracking document first

**Recommended branch:** `enoomian/pm-00-tracker`

## Objective

Create and maintain one working tracker so execution order, branch ownership, file ownership, and completion state are explicit.

## Checklist

- [x] Create a dedicated audit-readiness tracker markdown document
- [x] Record branch policy and hot-file ownership
- [x] Record AVAX-first execution override
- [x] Record exact items already completed
- [x] Record which items are only partially done / still in PR
- [x] Record merge order and dependency order
- [x] Record done criteria for auditor-invite readiness

## Deliverable

- [x] `prediction-market-audit-readiness-tracker.md`

---

# Current execution order (overrides original sequencing)

1. **Step 0:** tracking document
2. **Priority AVAX:** finish `avax/prod-proofing` completely
3. **Priority 1:** `enoomian/pm-16-resolution-truth`
4. **Priority 2:** `enoomian/pm-17a-evm-order-semantics`
5. **Priority 3:** `enoomian/pm-17b-solana-order-semantics`
6. **Priority 4:** `enoomian/pm-20-governance-controls`
7. **Priority 5:** `enoomian/pm-21-protocol-guardrails`
8. **Priority 7:** `enoomian/pm-22-required-gates-and-audit-packet`

> Important execution rule: shared EVM contract logic does **not** go into `avax/prod-proofing`. If AVAX work reveals shared EVM contract changes are needed, those changes must be logged and moved into a non-AVAX branch off sprint base.

---

# Branch policy

## Global

- [x] Base branch for all work is `enoomian/prediction-market-sprint-base`
- [x] AVAX-specific deployment/runtime/proof work stays in `avax/prod-proofing`
- [x] Shared EVM contract changes must go to non-AVAX branches
- [x] Each workstream gets its own PR into sprint base
- [x] Hot-file ownership must be respected to avoid collisions

## Hot-file ownership map

### `packages/evm-contracts/contracts/DuelOutcomeOracle.sol`

- PM16 owns lifecycle / finality semantics
- PM20 owns governance / role freeze
- PM21 owns final unsafe-state guard rails

### `packages/evm-contracts/contracts/GoldClob.sol`

- PM17A owns order semantics / matching / settlement / claim parity docs
- PM20 owns admin / pause / fee-control freeze
- PM21 owns final protocol blocking rules

### `packages/hyperbet-solana/anchor/programs/fight_oracle/src/lib.rs`

- PM16 owns oracle lifecycle and dispute-window parity
- PM20 owns initializer / authority cleanup
- PM21 owns final safety assertions

### `packages/hyperbet-solana/anchor/programs/gold_clob_market/src/lib.rs`

- PM17B owns Solana order semantics / continuation / STP parity / claim semantics
- PM20 owns config authority and bootstrap cleanup
- PM21 owns final market-state guard rails

### `packages/hyperbet-chain-registry/src/index.ts`

- `avaxFuji` and `avax` blocks are owned by `avax/prod-proofing` only

---

# Completed before tracker creation

These items are already complete and should be preserved when later branches are cut.

## Solana cancel surface alignment

- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/generated/ts/instructions/cancelDuel.ts`
  - renamed `cancelDuel` account/signature surface from `reporter` to `authority`
  - updated parsed instruction keys

- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/app/src/generated/fight-oracle/instructions/cancelDuel.ts`
  - same `reporter -> authority` alignment

- [x] `packages/simulation-dashboard/src/backends/solana/program-runtime.ts`
  - updated `cancelDuel` callsite to pass `authority`

## Solana repeated-init role preservation

- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/anchor/programs/fight_oracle/src/lib.rs`
  - bootstrap initialize path now avoids re-applying default roles on repeated init
  - configured `authority`, `finalizer`, `challenger`, and `dispute window` are preserved once set

## Important note

- [ ] These completed items do **not** mean PM16, PM20, or PM21 are complete as workstreams
- [ ] These completed items do **not** satisfy the branch-level exit criteria for audit readiness

# Priority AVAX — `avax/prod-proofing`

**Status:** `[~] in progress`

**Why first:** user-directed execution order override. AVAX work already exists in PR #20, and this tracker prioritizes finishing the AVAX completion track before moving to PM16.

## Objective

Finish all AVAX-specific deployment truth, proof rails, and runbook work on `avax/prod-proofing` without mixing in shared EVM protocol changes.

## Files owned by this branch

- `packages/hyperbet-chain-registry/src/index.ts`
  - `avaxFuji` block
  - `avax` block
- `packages/hyperbet-avax/keeper/avax-fuji-bootstrap.mjs`

- `.github/workflows/staged-live-proof.yml`
- `docs/prediction-market-release-prep.md`
- `docs/enoomian-next-phase-gates.md` (AVAX status only)

## Already present in PR #20 (do not redo, but verify and carry forward)

- [~] `packages/hyperbet-avax/keeper/avax-fuji-bootstrap.mjs`
  - harden fresh tradable market bootstrap flow
- [~] `packages/hyperbet-avax/keeper/avax-fuji-bootstrap.mjs`

- [~] `docs/runbooks/README.md`
  - runbook index updated
- [~] `packages/hyperbet-avax/keeper/avax-fuji-bootstrap.mjs`
  - PR #20 says explicit env keys are required for Fuji script; verify implementation matches runbook exactly

## Remaining AVAX completion checklist

### A. Canonical deployment truth

- [x] Fill `packages/hyperbet-chain-registry/src/index.ts` `avaxFuji` block with canonical non-placeholder values (all deployment + governance fields are populated in-registry and reflected by tests)
- [ ] Fill `packages/hyperbet-chain-registry/src/index.ts` `avax` block with canonical non-placeholder values
- [x] Commit canonical AVAX Fuji oracle/goldClob/admin/marketOperator/treasury/marketMaker addresses
- [ ] Commit canonical AVAX mainnet oracle/goldClob/admin/marketOperator/treasury/marketMaker addresses
- [x] Commit Fuji signer truth (`reporterAddress`, `finalizerAddress`, `challengerAddress`, `timelockAddress`, `multisigAddress`, `emergencyCouncilAddress`) in the registry
- [ ] Commit AVAX mainnet signer truth (`reporterAddress`, `finalizerAddress`, `challengerAddress`, `timelockAddress`, `multisigAddress`, `emergencyCouncilAddress`) in the registry
- [ ] Verify no AVAX deploy-critical fields remain blank or placeholder for mainnet

### B. Bootstrap / smoke / operator flow

- [ ] Verify PR #20 bootstrap script against current Fuji deployment reality
- [ ] Verify env variable names used by script exactly match runbook
- [ ] Verify the runbook does not claim behavior the script does not implement
- [ ] Verify `MARKET_OPERATOR_ROLE` assumptions against deployed AVAX/Fuji GoldClob
- [ ] Run fresh market bootstrap smoke on Fuji using the hardened script
- [ ] Capture evidence of successful create/sync/place/cancel/claim or skip-claim path on Fuji
- [ ] Record expected outputs / failure modes in the runbook

### C. Proof and workflow promotion

- [ ] Update `.github/workflows/prediction-market-gates.yml` to reflect canonical AVAX support after registry truth lands
- [ ] Update `.github/workflows/staged-live-proof.yml` to reflect AVAX proof posture after registry truth lands
- [ ] Ensure AVAX proof lanes are not promoted prematurely before canonical truth is committed
- [ ] Define AVAX-specific required secrets / env vars for proof execution
- [ ] Add or update workflow comments so future operators know AVAX promotion conditions

### D. Release / status docs

- [ ] Update `docs/prediction-market-release-prep.md` when AVAX status becomes canonical
- [ ] Update `docs/enoomian-next-phase-gates.md` when AVAX moves from fail-closed / incomplete to canonical
- [ ] Ensure PR #11 “open post-merge work” items are reflected consistently once AVAX truth lands
- [ ] Make sure docs distinguish Fuji smoke proof from AVAX production canonicalization

### E. Out-of-band ops dependencies to track here but not implement in code branch

- [!] Create `staging` GitHub environment if still missing
- [!] Load required staging vars and secrets
- [!] Execute Gate 14A staged live proof in read-only mode
- [!] Execute Gate 14A staged live proof in canary-write mode

## Exit criteria for AVAX completion

- [ ] AVAX registry entries are fully populated and not placeholder/fail-closed
- [ ] PR #20 functionality is merged or otherwise present in the target branch
- [ ] Fuji bootstrap flow is verified end-to-end against current deployment reality
- [ ] AVAX proof lanes and docs agree with actual deployment truth
- [ ] No shared EVM protocol changes were incorrectly added to `avax/prod-proofing`

## Gate to move on to PM16

- [ ] AVAX branch checklist is complete or explicitly split into code-complete + ops-follow-up with no code blockers remaining

# Priority 1 — `enoomian/pm-16-resolution-truth`

**Status:** `[~] partially started, not complete`

## Objective

Finish oracle resolution truth and finality closure on both EVM and Solana so settlement can only happen from correct terminal finalized states, with parity on dispute-window behavior and clearly governed cancellation semantics.

## Files owned by this branch

  - `cancelDuel(...)`
  - `proposeResult(...)`
  - `challengeResult(...)`

## Already done inside this workstream

- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/generated/ts/instructions/cancelDuel.ts`
  - `reporter -> authority` alignment done
- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/app/src/generated/fight-oracle/instructions/cancelDuel.ts`
  - `reporter -> authority` alignment done
- [x] `packages/simulation-dashboard/src/backends/solana/program-runtime.ts`
  - callsite updated to pass `authority`
- [x] `packages/hyperbet-solana/anchor/programs/fight_oracle/src/lib.rs`
  - repeated init no longer blindly overwrites configured roles

## Remaining checklist

### A. EVM cancellation and finality semantics

- [ ] Redesign `DuelOutcomeOracle.sol::cancelDuel(...)` so launch-path cancellation is not just a routine reporter action
- [ ] Decide whether cancellation is part of standard truth/finality flow or emergency-only flow
- [ ] If emergency-only, document owner, allowed states, and downstream claim/refund consequences
- [ ] Add regression tests for cancellation behavior and unauthorized cancellation attempts

### B. Solana oracle config parity

- [ ] Change `fight_oracle::update_oracle_config(...)` so `dispute_window_secs` must be strictly positive
- [ ] Remove / stop relying on “reporter is also finalizer/challenger” as a production default in `initialize_oracle(...)`
- [ ] Review all initialize-time defaults for audit suitability
- [ ] Add tests proving zero-second dispute window is impossible

### C. Cross-chain lifecycle proof

- [ ] Add EVM tests proving settlement is impossible before terminal finalization
- [ ] Add Solana tests proving settlement is impossible before terminal finalization
- [ ] Add tests for propose/challenge/finalize timing boundaries
- [ ] Add tests for challenge-window bypass attempts
- [ ] Add tests for invalid finalize after challenge or before dispute window expiry
- [ ] Add tests for repeat finalize / double-transition attempts

### D. Docs and parity surfaces

- [ ] Update `docs/oracle-finality-model.md` to reflect final implemented behavior
- [ ] Update `docs/protocol/cross-chain-parity-matrix.md` for oracle lifecycle parity
- [ ] Ensure generated instruction surfaces and docs tell the same story for Solana cancel authority

## Exit criteria

- [ ] No ambiguous routine reporter cancellation path remains
- [ ] Zero-second dispute window is impossible on both chains
- [ ] Settlement only occurs from correct terminal finalized states
- [ ] Oracle docs and parity matrix match implementation exactly

# Notes for future updates

When a task is completed, update all three places:

1. the checkbox under the relevant branch section
2. the status line for that branch
3. the auditor-invite readiness checklist if the item affects final readiness

If a task is implemented in an open PR but not merged, keep it as `[~]` until merged and verified.
